title: Three Months of GZCLP
---

I've been running [GZCLP](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/gzclp/) for the past semester, which is a linear progression for beginners like SS/SL but with more balance between each of the compound lifts and varying rep ranges. The way it works is that each day contains "T1" movement done for low reps high intensity and a "T2" movement done for high reps low intensity along with "T3" accessory work. T1s start off at 5x3 and then shift to 6x2, 10x1, and then deloading and restarting at 5x3 when you miss reps. The following table records the highest numbers I was able to reach attempting 10x1 before resetting the cycle, all in pounds.

|                | Start        | End          | Improvement |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| Squat          | 205 (Nov 30) | 235 (Apr 21) | +30         |
| Bench Press    | 135 (Nov 22) | 150 (May 5)  | +15         |
| Deadlift       | 225 (Nov 28) | 265 (May 7)  | +40         |
| Overhead Press | 95 (Nov 20)  | 105 (Mar 30) | +10         |

Technically, this isn't the same as a true max. I haven't bothered to test for an actual max, but if I had to guess, the difference would be small—maybe another 10 lbs for lower body lifts and 5 lbs for upper body lifts. I actually haven't gotten to reset T1 deadlifts or bench press this semester, but I doubt I had very much further to go at all.

Given that I basically didn't train for almost all of December and January because of winter break and UT's decision to keep the first two weeks of spring 2022 online, these stats correspond roughly to an increase of 10 lbs/month for lower body and 5 lbs/month for upper body. Not prodigy-levels of progress but solid for me personally. Extrapolating this would give exactly 14 months or just before the last year of undergrad to get into the thousand pound club. This is most likely a pretty optimistic assumption but a worthwhile goal to work towards. We're All Gonna Make It™ :)
