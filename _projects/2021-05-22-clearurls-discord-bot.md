Have you ever noticed those `utm` and `fbclid` snippets in links? Those are used to track your activity and unnecessary for the site to work. This bot uses the [Unalix](https://github.com/AmanoTeam/Unalix) library that is based off of the popular [ClearURLs](https://github.com/ClearURLs/Addon) browser extension to automatically strip out such parameters from links. This keeps URLs short and readable while enhancing the privacy of your server's members.
